Need to test open mode operation for sinks.

specie_meta needs specie_definition objects to manage extra parameters.

Remove unused constants nionmx, fvermx, filver etc from constants.Xpp

Setting of program version, compiler data etc.

Errors reported from the input file should be consistently formatted. This
could be achieved by consistent use of the input_base_reader and
input_error_message classes.

Make "type" in the input file a special keyword by adding "has_type" method
to CLASS_meta.

Some samplers/evaluators may find they are unused during the "prepare"
method. They should be able to signal this to their manager classes.  The
manager may want to move them out of the active set, but my not want 
to immediately delete them.

* IDEA: Library is locked into using a set of properties of specie and
 change_atom/change_set that are specific to ion channel simulation.
 Look into how to support properties that are domain specific. Such 
 properties sets are generic rather than dynamic (ie fixed at 
 compile-time rather than at run-time)

* implement PNP set_temperature, set_voltage

* add and implement poisson_equations

* run hollerbach test1

* review design:

 ** appropriate factorisation

 ** visibility

* python

 ** external-code interface

  *** push, pull and async possible?

* logging (levels)
