Examine the files

    Makedefs.alpha
    Makedefs.generic
    Makedefs.hp
    Makedefs.ibm
    Makedefs.iris
    Makedefs.linux
    Makedefs.solaris
    Makedefs.sun

and see which one fits your system best; these are samples, and may
not fit any given system exactly. Make any necessary modifications,
then type

    make 'system'

where 'system' is whichver one you chose of

    'alpha', 'generic', 'hp', 'ibm', 'iris', 'linux', 'solaris', or 'sun'

This sets up a symbolic link to the appropriate Makedefs, and
only needs to be done once (per system). Next type

    make clean pnp_funnel

Expect to (possibly) see a warning about the variable 'smp' being used
before it is defined; this is normal.  After that, you should be able
to run pnp_funnel. Two commented sample input files, 'test1.input' and
'test2.input', are provided; you can try running them with the following
commands:

	pnp_funnel < test1.input > your1.output
	pnp_funnel < test2.input > your2.output

Then compare the files 'your1.output' against 'test1.output', and
'your2.output' against 'test2.output'. The data should be exceedingly
similar. For comparison, the file 'comp1.output' contains the output
of another PNP program which solved for exactly the same physical
situation as specified in 'test1.input'. The first run takes about 6
seconds of CPU time on a Pentium-133, and the second about 33 seconds
on the same machine.
