* input_help system converted from using Boost command line argument
library to internal classes for managing help. Additional features
enabled during the change are:

 ** Allow sub-types and their options to be easily and clearly
 documented.

 ** Move building of documentation from input_base_meta derived
 ctors to a separate method.

 ** input_base_meta_subtype: Definition of "type" definitions. This
 should manage the label of the subtype and its valid "non-standard"
 options. Help documentation for the options should also be
 provided. (see choice_definition idea in trial library)

 ** Include input filename and line number in error messages
 triggered in CLASS_meta.do_read_entry.

Updated/checked unit tests for

* Rewrite unit tests to avoid reusing objects that have thrown an
exception. Sometimes this is not avoidable, in which case only check
for cases where we should have a strong exception safety guarantee.

* All thrown exception in unit tests are checked for type and the correct
error message for generic exceptions.

message not just for throwing an error.

Two options for adding input definition objects to meta objects:

Choice 1: Static methods written as "defn* CLASS::make_definition()"
do not know about CLASS_meta when they don't need to.

Choice 2: Static methods writen as CLASS::add_definition( CLASS_meta
&meta ) know about CLASS_meta but hide definition object.

Decided to use choice 2 as knowledge of CLASS_meta within a library
is better than requiring the user to know about the meta class. This
is particularly the case for the observable library where two lists of
definitions is maintained for the two basic types of observables.

* Removed unnecessary cross-dependencies between libraries:

 ** introduce "manager" classes for evaluator, particle, sampler etc
 libraries. Refactor functionality from the simulator class into the
 manager class to eliminate cross-dependencies.

 ** Each manager class is associated with a corresponding input_base_meta
 class. The base class is blind to this association.

Up to this date code underwent several refactorings to convert from
primarily functional code to object-oriented. This was done with the
intent of laying the ground work for a more easily extensible and flexible
final program.
